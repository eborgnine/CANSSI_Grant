# Research Aims

<!-- Limit to 5 pages, including references (include all details). Will be expanded to 7 pages in the full proposal -->

We will develop a fully Bayesian implementation of the *groupwise additive index model* (GAIM), a constrained frequentest version of which is introduced in @pierre2020aim. For a response distribution $D$, parameter $\theta = (\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{d})$, and link function $g$, the GAIM is,

\vspace{-0.75em}
$$
\begin{aligned}
  Y_{t} | \theta_{t} &= D( \theta ), \\
  g( \theta ) &= X\beta + 
        \sum\limits_{i=1}^{I} s_{i}(\alpha_{1}\gamma_{1,t} + \ldots + \alpha_{n_{i}}\gamma_{n_{i},t})+ 
        \sum\limits_{k=1}^{K} f_{k}( \eta_{k} )
\end{aligned}
$$
$Y_{t}$ is the outcome of interest, $X$ is a design matrix, and $\beta$ is a vector of fixed effects. The second sum consists of $K$ smoothing functions $f_{1}, \ldots, f_{K}$ applied to potential confounders $\eta_{k}$. The novelty lies in its first sum, which fits smooth functions to a weighted sum (*mixture*) of potentially time-varying covariates. 

The GAIM is a flexible and extensible statistical model with a wide variety of potential applications, as the researcher can choose the number $I$ of smooth functions $s_{i}$ and the number of covariates $n_{i}$ in each $s_{i}$. Possible epidemiological applications include examining the health effects of environmental exposures, such as chemical mixtures, metal mixtures, pesticides, and mixtures of air pollutants [@sanders2015perinatal; @braun2016can; @lazarevic2019statistical; @bobb2015bayesian]. For example, a possible air pollution model could have one smooth function $s_{1}$ and two covariates $\gamma_{1,t}$ and $\gamma_{2,t}$, where $\gamma_{1,t}$ is the (time-varying) concentration of ozone (O~3~) and $\gamma_{2,t}$ is the (time-varying) concentration of particulate matter less than 2.5 $\mu$g (PM~2.5~). In this case, the weights $\alpha = (\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2})$ give the relative contribution of O~3~ and PM~2.5~ to the health outcome of interest. Another possible model could have 3 additional pollutants -- nitrogen dioxide (NO~2~), sulfur dioxide (SO~2~), and particulate matter less than 10 $\mu$g (PM~10~) -- such that the 5 weights $\alpha$ give the relative contribution of each pollutant. The models could also include interaction terms, or additional smooth functions $s_{i}$ that group the pollutants in a scientifically justified way.

To explore the benefits of the GAIM, we next compare it to a standard regression model and one where the $s_{i}$ have a more general form. To ease notation, let us assume there are no confounders, one smooth function $s_{1}$, and two covariates, $\gamma_{1,t}$ and $\gamma_{2,t}$, in $s_{1}$. Then, these 3 models have link functions,
$$
\begin{aligned}
  g( \theta ) &= X\beta + \alpha_{1}\gamma_{1} + \alpha_{2}\gamma_{2} & \hspace{100pt} \text{ (1)  } \\
  g( \theta ) &= X\beta + s_{1}(\alpha_{1}\gamma_{1} + \alpha_{2}\gamma_{2}) & \hspace{100pt} \text{ (2) } \\
  g( \theta ) &= X\beta + s_{1}^{*}(\gamma_{1}, \gamma_{2}) & \hspace{100pt} \text{ (3) } \\
\end{aligned}
$$
(1) specifies a regression model with 2 fixed effects, $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$, (2) specifies a GAIM with 2 weights $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$, and (3) specifies $s_{1}^{*}$ as a 2-dimensional smoothing function. Compared to the linear regression in (1), the GAIM is more flexible. The inclusion of $s_{1}$ allows it to capture nonlinearities in the relationship between $\gamma_{1,t}$, $\gamma_{2,t}$ and the outcome $Y_{t}$. Compared to (3), the GAIM is less computationally demanding -- $\alpha_{1}\gamma_{1,t} + \alpha_{2}\gamma_{2,t}$ is always 1-dimensional, and remains so regardless of how many terms are the sum. This contrasts with $s^{*}_{1}$, whose dimensionality scales with its number of arguments. The GAIM is also more interpretable than (3). The weights $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ reflect the relative contribution of $\gamma_{1,t}$ and $\gamma_{2,t}$, respectively.  In comparison, $s^{*}_{1}(\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2})$ has no such weights, and often has no interpretable parameters.

We will develop a fully Bayesian implementation of the GAIM in Stan, a widely used statistical modeling language that performs inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo [@carpenter2017stan]. No Bayesian implementation of the GAIM currently exists; developing a robust implementation and releasing an R package would be a significant contribution towards accessible and interpretable dimension-reduction models with epidemiological applications. Developing a robust Bayesian implementation includes identifying suitable priors for the weights $\alpha$ and methods for imposing shape constraints, such as monotonicity and convexity, on the $s_{i}$. We will also develop non-MCMC inference methods for these models, similar to those seen in @rue2009approximate, to facilitate wider use of the GAIM. 



## Research Questions

In the course of this project, we will use the GAIM to explore the health effects of multiple air pollutants. Recent years have seen increased interest in modeling the joint effect of two or more pollutants in health outcomes [@dominici2010protecting; @billionnet2012estimating; @davalos2017current]. Bayesian approaches can be seen in @blangiardo2019hierarchical, @bobb2013reduced, and @huang2018multivariate. We will consider two research questions in the course of our inquiry, namely,
  
  1. What is the combined effect of multiple pollutants on various daily mortality outcomes?, and
  2. What is the relationship between daily COVID-19 mortality and air pollution? 
  
  
### Question 1

The workhorse of the (predominantly frequentist) air pollution literature is the one-pollutant log-linear Poisson regression model. This model accounts for confounders using fixed effects and smooth functions, such as the natural cubic spline [@samet2000fine; @dominici2002use; @liu2019ambient]. Let the average rate an outcome occurs on day $t$ be denoted by $\lambda_{t}$. Then, a typical one-pollutant model is, 

\vspace{-0.50em}
$$
\begin{aligned}
  Y_{t} | \lambda_{t} &= \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{t}), \\
  \log(\lambda_{t}) &= X\beta + \gamma_{1} P_{1,t} + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{K} f_{k}(\eta_{k}).
\end{aligned}
$$
Here, $Y_{t}$ is the health outcome of interest, such as respiratory mortality or morbidity. The design matrix $X$ contains day-of-the-week effects and seasonal terms, and the $f_{i}(\eta_{k,*})$ are smooth functions of potential confounders such as time and temperature. One extension of this model would fit $P_{1,t}$ to a smooth function $s_{1}$. More generally, we could fit $N$ pollutants to $N$ smooth functions, $s_{1}, \ldots, s_{N}$. A third alternative, which we propose here, is to model $N$ pollutants using the GAIM. 

Air pollution is an excellent application area for the GAIM. People are exposed to the mixture of pollutants in their environment, many of which are highly correlated [@guowen2020multi]. Thus, health effects the single pollutant model attributes to $P_{1}$ may very well be caused by a correlated pollutant, or only be present within certain combinations of a mixture of pollutants. Indeed, @franklin2008impact found that the effect of ozone on non-accidental mortality was "substantially reduced" after adjusting for particle sulfate. In @liu2019ambient, the authors found significant differences in the percentage change in all-cause mortality attributable to PM~2.5~ and PM~10~ when adjusting for NO~2~ or SO~2~.

It is therefore crucial to extend the one-pollutant model in a way that attributes health effects to the correct mixture of pollutants. This suggests using a model that conducts inference on mixtures. As for extending the $s_{i}$ to be non-linear, there is evidence that some health outcomes are nonlinearly related to pollution levels, and that synergistic effects occur when multiple pollutants are present at higher levels [@feng2016impact; @xia2006cumulative]. These extensions make the GAIM especially well-suited to estimating nonlinear effects of (pollutant) mixtures: the smooth function(s) $s_{i}$ estimate the effects of their respective weighted sums, where the weights give the relative contribution of the components.

The multiple pollutant problem has received increased intention in recent years. . Five approaches are detailed in @davalos2017current. Of these 5 methods, they note that adding additive main effects can lead to biased estimates in the presence of highly correlated variables, and that nonparameteric methods are often not very interpretable. The research teams and stakeholders involved in air pollution research are often diverse and inter-disciplinary. This makes it crucial that models have interpretable parameters, so that estimation results can be easily communicated to non-specialists. While the unsupervised dimension reduction methods (such as principle components analysis and clustering) identified in @davalos2017current are difficult to interpret, they note some supervised methods that consider weighted sums of pollutant concentrations. For example,  @pachon2012development specify weights from data rather than estimating them, while @roberts2006investigating introduces a model that is equivalent to assuming that $s_{1}$ is linear. While these are viable statistical methods, they are not as flexible or extensible as the GAIM.

@davalos2017current also discusses non-parametric methods, including Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR). BKMR allows for estimation and variable selection. It was introduced in @bobb2015bayesian, and an R package was released with @bobb2018statistical. BKMR models an exposure-response surface -- the exposures can be pollutants and the response nonaccidental mortality -- via a kernel function. Using a hierarchical Bayesian variable selection method, BKMR can select one pollutant from a group of correlated ones, and is interpreted by visualizing cross-sections of a potentially high-dimensional exposure-response surface. Unlike the GAIM, it does not have easily interpretable parameters. This makes the GAIM more suitable to the communication demands of inter-disciplinary research areas such as air pollution.

While there has been significant research interest in the multiple pollutant problem, the models proposed to date have either computational limitations or limited interpretability. In contrast, the GAIM has interpretable parameters and its computational burden does not scale with the dimensionality of its inputs. Therefore, using the GAIM to examine the health effect of a mixture of pollutants will provide interpretable and communicable results on this research question. Finally, note that while air pollution is the main example in this proposal, the GAIM has applications wherever the target of inference is a mixture of covariates that relate nonlinearly to an outcome of interest. 


### Question 2

The relationship between daily COVID-19 deaths and air pollution levels has become an active area of research in recent months. For instance, @wu2020exposure apply a zero-inflated negative bionomial model U.S. data, where the zero-inflation accounts for U.S. counties with no COVID-19 deaths. They use a log-linear link function with a state-level random effect, and find that a 1 $\mu$g increase in long-term exposure to ambient PM~2.5~ increases the COVID-19 death rate by 15%. Additional studies that examine this relationship include @conticini2020can, @sciomer2020sars, and @setti2020searching. 

However, much work remains to be done. For instance, non-COVID-19 daily mortality data is generally not yet available, such that we do not have an accurate measure of excess deaths attributable to COVID-19, especially among vulnerable populations such as seniors. These excess deaths could be attributable to under-reported COVID-19 case and death counts (due to limited testing), restricted access to care for patients with other health conditions, or potential reporting delays. Moreover, cumulative COVID-19 mortality will likely continue to rise for some time, making the question of excess deaths due to COVID-19 best suited to an ongoing inquiry that may help inform subsequent public health responses.

We will use the GAIM to examine the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and long-term exposure to air pollution. Compared to the log-linear negative binomial model in @wu2020exposure, the GAIM is scaleable, interpretable, and can capture non-linearities in the relationship between mixtures and the response. To apply the GAIM to this research question, we must choose the outcome of interest $Y_{t}$ as COVID-19 deaths. To specifically investigate seniors, we may (for example) take $Y_{t}$ to be those aged 65+. Applying the GAIM to air pollution and COVID-19 death data will allow us to ascertain which mixtures of pollutants increase COVID-19 mortality, as well as how their effects differ among age groups. 

This inquiry will make two contributions to the growing COVID-19 literature. The first is that it will help determine how different mixtures of air pollutants amplify the impact of COVID-19. The second is that since people in different regions are exposed to different mixtures of pollutants, it will help identify which mixtures of pollutants have the largest impact on COVID-19 deaths. Both contributions will also further our understanding of the health impacts of air pollution.
