    abstract = "{Shape-constrained regression analysis has applications in dose-response modelling, environmental risk assessment, disease screening and many other areas. Incorporating the shape constraints can improve estimation efficiency and avoid implausible results. We propose a novel method, focusing on monotone curve and surface estimation, which uses Gaussian process projections. Our inference is based on projecting posterior samples from the Gaussian process. We develop theory on continuity of the projection and rates of contraction. Our approach leads to simple computation with good performance in finite samples. The proposed projection method can also be applied to other constrained-function estimation problems, including those in multivariate settings.}",

abstract = {Many situations call for a smooth strictly monotone function f of arbitrary flexibility. The family of functions defined by the differential equation D 2f =w Df, where w is an unconstrained coefficient function comprises the strictly monotone twice differentiable functions. The solution to this equation is f = C0 + C1 D−1{exp(D−1w)}, where C0 and C1 are arbitrary constants and D−1 is the partial integration operator. A basis for expanding w is suggested that permits explicit integration in the expression of f. In fitting data, it is also useful to regularize f by penalizing the integral of w2 since this is a measure of the relative curvature in f. Applications are discussed to monotone nonparametric regression, to the transformation of the dependent variable in non-linear regression and to density estimation.},
